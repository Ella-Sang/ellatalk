#### 1. How Chinese people greet each other
##### 1.1 Several classic ways
In addition to “hello,” Chinese people have many other ways of expressing themselves:
When two people haven't seen each other for a long time, they might say: " How have you been lately?“ ”Have you been busy lately?“ ”Where have you been making your fortune lately?" This expression carries a light-hearted and humorous tone and is more commonly used among acquaintances. It reflects the Chinese pursuit of **wealth and good fortune**, representing a more down-to-earth and colloquial way of offering blessings.  
When two people who frequently meet encounter each other, they might say: “Where are you going?”  
If it's mealtime, they might also ask: “Have you eaten yet?” " This greeting is very classic, as you mentioned, it indeed carries the **hunger memories** of a generation or even several generations. In the past, when material resources were scarce, whether one could eat enough was the most pressing concern for people. This greeting expresses basic concern for the other person's well-being and ensures they are not hungry, symbolizing a deep, simple friendship.

##### 1.2 How young people greet each other today
Today's young people, such as those born in the 1990s and 2000s, were born after China had already solved its food security issues and no longer faced the threat of hunger. Therefore, when they meet, they mostly say, “Hello,” rather than, “Have you eaten yet?” The younger generation is more relaxed and often uses internet slang terms like “baoer” or “jimei.” You might wonder what ‘jimei’ means—it's a pun on the word “sisters,” popularized by an internet celebrity on the Chinese social media platform Douyin.

#### 2. Greetings in English-speaking countries
Nowadays, people in the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand often say, “How are you?” when they meet. It's a simple greeting that shows concern for the other person. This is also interesting because the origin of this greeting can be traced back to medieval Europe's “How do you fare?” At that time, wars were frequent, medical conditions were poor, and people's lives were filled with uncertainty. Disease and death could strike at any moment. “How do you fare?” (How are you doing? / How are things going?), carried genuine **concern and care**, as “how well one was doing” and “whether one was healthy” were the most basic and important survival issues at the time. As the English language developed and spread, this greeting evolved into the modern “How are you?” and eventually became a universally recognized greeting among English speakers worldwide.

#### 3. The Role of Food in Interpersonal Relationships
Thus, it can be seen that language is a product of the social environment of its time, reflecting the living conditions of people at the time. In an era when people were often hungry, asking “Have you eaten?” upon meeting someone; in a socially turbulent environment, asking “How do you fare?” upon meeting someone;
